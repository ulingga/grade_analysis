This study is for the STAT995 final project
- 

The study aims to identify trends in academic performance, investigate the interrelationships between grades across Stage I, II, and III courses, and assess variations between student
cohorts using regression models. It further examines the impact of the COVID-19 disruption on academic outcomes and employs unsupervised learning techniques to identify student cohorts 
with similar academic profiles. The analysis is intended to support evidence-based academic decision-making, particularly in the context of the Board of Studies meetings and wider 
strategic planning.

The primary objectives of this project are:

- **Standardise Semester-Based Performance Analysis:** Develop a consistent and reusable approach to visualising and analysing MEDSCI student live grades for each semester.
This is intended to support timely, evidence-informed academic discussions during Board of Examiners and Board of Studies meetings.
- **Investigate Performance Trends by Course Selection:** Group students based on course selection patterns and explore how different academic pathways relate to performance in Stage III papers,
  including cross-cohort comparisons and grading consistency across shared papers.
- **Compare Academic Performance During and After COVID-19:** Assess differences in student grades between the COVID period (2020–2022) and the post-COVID period(2023–2024),
  accounting for the shift to online teaching and assessment, across both undergraduate and postgraduate MEDSCI papers.
- **Evaluate the Role of Foundational Courses in Stage III Success:** Examine how performance in MEDSCI 142 and Stage II papers relates to later outcomes in Stage III. The aim is to
identify early indicators that may help predict academic progression.
- **Identify Patterns of Overperformance and Underperformance:** Detect performance deviations across cohorts, particularly cases where students significantly outperform or
underperform relative to their Stage I paper (MEDSCI 142 as the baseline). This can help uncover long-term trends and inform future academic support strategies.

This study is completed using RStudio, due to it’s open source nature and a preference of the academic staff members.
